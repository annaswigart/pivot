# Pivot

Pivot is a web application that helps career changers explore new opportunities, compare career alternatives, and take next steps to make a career change happen. It provides a layer of analysis on top of job description data merged with government datasets, featuring a clean, intentional design that re-defines career discovery as a delightful experience.

This application was developed as a final deliverable for the [Master's Final Project](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims/projects/2015/pivot) by [UC Berkeley School of Information](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims) students Anna Swigart, Cameron Reed, and Tiffany Barkley.
